## Wireframes

### **Site Layout**

Site moc-ups were designed using [figma](figma). The focus was on defining the basic layout structure of the app and identifying how displays would change on different screen sizes such as mobile, tablet and larger screens.

You can view the wireframes created for this project in [site wireframes](/docs/wireframes.pdf) folder.

  **Please note, as we were developing the project, we have identified some weaknesses in the UX and therefore made the required changes. The deployed site looks somewhat different in comparison to the wireframes. These changes will allow the user to have a better experience and allow easier navigation. The design theme of the features is a close match to the overall site to ensure continuation and flow.*
